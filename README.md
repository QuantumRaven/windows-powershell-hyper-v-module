# Checkpoint-VM.ps1
## Role of script:
- Prompts user to pick a virtual machine for checkpoint creation.
- Prompts user to assign a custom name for the checkpoint.
- Creates a checkpoint based on the answers to the arguments.

### Checkpoint-VM: What it is and how it works:
> The Checkpoint-VM cmdlet creates a checkpoint of a virtual machine.
>
> Note: In Windows Server 2012 R2, virtual machine snapshots were renamed to virtual machine checkpoints. For clarity, this document will refer to virtual machine snapshots as checkpoints. - [Checkpoint-VM - Hyper-V - PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/checkpoint-vm?view=win10-ps)

Example:

 `Checkpoint-VM -VMName deblab -SnapshotName base_2020-09-30` would create a checkpoint for the virtual machine deblab and name it base_2020-09-30. So, if something were to go wrong during the use of said VM, you could turn the VM off and store from any checkpoint tied to it and go from there.

# Connect-VHD.ps1
## Role of script:
- Utilizes custom variables along with the `New-VHD` and `Add-VMHardDiskDrive` cmdlets to create and attach VHDs or Virtual Hard Drives.

### New-VHD: What it is and how it works:
> The New-VHD cmdlet creates one or more new virtual hard disks in either VHD format or the newer VHDX format. The file name extension you specify determines the format. - [New-VHD - Hyper-V - PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/new-vhd?view=win10-ps)

Example:

`New-VHD -Path D:\VM_Storage\disk0.vhdx -SizeBytes 10GB`
- Creates a virtual hard disk in the VHDX format. The file name extension you specify determines the format.

### Add-VMHardDiskDrive: What it is and how it works:
> The Add-VMHardDiskDrive cmdlet adds a hard disk drive to a virtual machine. - [Add-VMHardDiskDrive - Hyper-V - PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/hyper-v/add-vmharddiskdrive?view=win10-ps)

Example:

`Add-VMHardDiskDrive -VMName Test -Path D:\VM_Storage\disk0.vhdx`
- Creates a virtual hard disk using file D:\VM_Storage\disk0.vhdx on virtual machine Test.

# Disconnect-VHD.ps1
## Role of script:
- Disconnects a VHD file from a specified virtual machine.

### Remove-VMHardDiskDrive: What it is and how it works:

### Remove-Item: What it is and how it works:
> The Remove-Item cmdlet deletes one or more items. Because it is supported by many providers, it can delete many different types of items, including files, folders, registry keys, variables, aliases, and functions. - [Remove-Item - Microsoft.PowerShell.Management - PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/remove-item?view=powershell-7)

### Write-Host: What it is and what it does:
> The `Write-Host` cmdlet's primary purpose is to produce for-(host)-display-only output, such as printing colored text like when prompting the user for input in conjunction with [Read-Host](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/read-host?view=powershell-7). `Write-Host` uses the [ToString()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.object.tostring) method to write the output. By contrast, to output data to the pipeline, use [Write-Output](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/Microsoft.PowerShell.Utility/write-output?view=powershell-7) or implicit output.
